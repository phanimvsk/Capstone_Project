the area of computer science that deals
with image classification
object detection video processing and so
on
is called computer vision due to
advancements in deep learning
especially convolutional neural network
or
cnn it has been possible to do
amazing things in computer vision in
this video we are going to look at
some of the real life applications of
computer vision the first application of
computer vision is
image classification and object
detection this is something you already
have
on your mobile phone once me and my
brother
were walking in a park and we saw a
plant
which looked like a poison ivy but we
were not sure
so i took my google pixel and google
pixel has this application
google lens used that it immediately
told me that this is poison ivy
if you touch poison iv it can create a
blister on your skin so it is very
poisonous plant and that was my first
experience of using computer vision
for a real benefit also when i'm
having so many pictures you know on my
google pixel
for finding pictures of fruits
i have to just write fruits and it knows
to identify those fruits so it is doing
image classification
underneath mostly using convolutional
neural network
and finding fruit images from all the
images
even to identify people i have all these
people my mom my cousin brother everyone
their pictures are there in my phone and
if i want to find
someone's picture let's say hersh petal
is my nephew if i
want to find his pictures i just
uh tag that this person is hospital and
the computer
using computer vision it will identify
the images so the image search
the object detection has been so much
accurate
using a convolutional neural network
especially
the second application is in the field
of banking
i never go to a bank to deposit my check
i have bank of america account
i use my mobile application to deposit a
check
when i take an image of a cheque it will
do image recognization
it will find out the check number the
amount
who is depositing the check and
everything i'm going to play a
short clip by bank of america this is on
youtube
depositing a check is simple with our
bank of america mobile banking app
start by opening your app signing into
your account and selecting
deposit checks then take a picture of
the front and back of the endorsed check
with your smartphone or tablet hold your
device steady
directly over the check and the photo
will be taken automatically
once both sides are captured the third
area where it is being used is
agriculture i'm again going to play a
video from cambridge consultant it shows
how computer vision can help in
agriculture area
you'll see a clip where it will be
detecting the
apples on a tree and that can give you
an estimate on your yield
as a farmer you can predict how much you
you are going to get
especially when you have big farms you
can use like a drone
and do amazing things in the field of
agriculture so let's look at that clip
[Music]
if we look back the 20th century was all
about making agricultural machines
bigger but this clearly couldn't
continue forever
what we really need to be doing is
looking after plants and soil at a more
individual level
so to do this we need to make machines
smarter
and smarter means taking care of plants
individually
weeding spraying and thinning or
identifying fruit not just counting them
but providing yield and science
estimates
what's missing is the ability for
machines to discern plant health
or to spot weeds amongst a crop
artificial intelligence is about to
change this
machines can now be trained to recognize
shapes and textures
the example you're seeing is using the
texture of leaves
to single them out as weeds or as plants
that need special treatment
the commercial success of systems like
these depend on taking into
consideration
the whole package the software hardware
and the business case
we've seen these technologies make huge
steps forward and we're already using
them to deliver systems that just a few
years ago would not have been possible
ai is making new means of farming
possible not just the machines
but the ways in which farming is done
so the question isn't how will air
affect your business
it's how will ai prove your business
the next application that you all
probably know about
is autonomous cars here in u.s
if you get tesla 3 tesla model 3 or any
tesla car
it has this auto pilot feature and i'm
going to again play a clip
and it works i have seen that working
people can also
summon the car so i was standing uh
in a parking lot with my friend once
and his car was parked a little far away
it was tesla model 3 and he summoned the
car so car automatically came to us
also when there was a rainy day
and if my friend is shopping sometimes
he has a little
child so it might be hard to walk from
the store to a parking lot because it
rains too much
and on that occasion he will auto summon
his car
and the car will automatically come to
his place
so these are again the real life
application which i have personally
experienced
and it is damn good and all of this is
possible because
tesla car has so many cameras it will
detect all the objects
and do the decision making in a right
way
all of this is possible because of deep
learning and convolutional neural
networks

[Music]
the next big industry where computer
vision is
bringing revolution is retail here in us
in new york city and in seattle there
are amazon go stores
you might have seen the video but these
stores actually exist
and all these applications which we have
discussed so far
they are happening right now it's not
like some dummy video
in amazon go store there is no employee
everything is been done by robots
cameras and computer vision so
let's see a little video clip on amazon
go
four years ago we started to wonder
[Music]
what would shopping look like if you
could walk into a store
grab what you want and just go
what if we could weave the most advanced
machine learning computer vision
and ai into the very fabric of a store
so you
never have to wait in line no lines no
checkouts
no registers
[Music]
welcome to amazon go
use the amazon go app to enter
then put away your phone and start
shopping
it's really that simple take whatever
you like
anything you pick up is automatically
added to your virtual cart
if you change your mind about that
cupcake
just put it back our technology will
update your virtual cart
[Music]
automatically
how does it work we used computer vision
deep learning algorithms and sensor
fusion much like you'd find in
self-driving cars
we call it just walk out technology
once you've got everything you want you
can just go
when you leave our just walk out
technology adds up your virtual cart and
charges your amazon account
your receipt is sent straight to the app
and you can keep
going amazon go
these were only few industries i
mentioned actually
there are many more industries i am
going to link a video from google
please watch that talk because there
they have mentioned
in detail about applications of computer
vision
in various industries such as warehouse
automation
damage analysis medical is another big
one
so it is disrupting pretty much all the
industries
and all of this is possible because of
deep learning
because of convolutional neural network
