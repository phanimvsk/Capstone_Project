 new series on machine learning with Python in this tutorial. We are going to look into what is machine learning
There are certain tasks where computers are really better than humans
For example, if I ask you to multiply these two big numbers you will take lot of time
Whereas computers can do it in less than a second
similarly if I ask you to search through
millions of Records then that search operation is extremely difficult for humans whereas machines can
Do it in a matter of nano second on
The other hand there are some tasks where humans outperform machines such as driving the car
You don't see many robots driving the car on the road today
In Bay Area a Google and uber and Tesla
These companies are trying or travel less cars, but it is still in initial phase as of 2018
So most of the cars driven on the road are still by humans
Natural language conversation is also an area where humans outperform machines
So machine learning tries to make computers better at things where traditionally
humans were outperforming machines and
the way we do that is
We make machines learn things like humans do
so the question is
Why humans are better in driving the cars and having a conversation?
For that we need to understand how human brain works
human brain consists of tiny neurons there are billions of neurons in our brain and
Whenever we think or make a decision a
Signal a chemical signal is generated and these a tiny neurons light up
here is a simple model of these neurons where these rounds are the neurons and the arrows are the synapses that
Connect these neurons
So what happens is?
let's say when you have a baby and baby sees a
cow for the first time
You will tell baby that this is a cow so internal in her brain
Specific set of neurons will light up and these two output neurons each corresponds to a
specific entity such as cow and a car
When you say that, this is a cow
This set of neurons are lighting up and the edges they become stronger
These edges are shown in yellow in a blue dark color here and it leads to a certain output
This is like you're you are in a jungle and you are looking for a direction
Now you found a direction to reach to a specific destination
Next day when baby sees a second cow you will tell the baby that ok
This is also a cow. So again same set of neurons and some additional neurons light up and these pathways become more stronger
Similarly when a baby is seeing a car you will tell her that this is a car and
Some other set of neurons will light up the ages will become stronger and so forth
This way you are training a baby. Ok
So as a human we all know in our childhood the way we learn things are
We make mistakes someone corrects the mistakes and then we learn
During the learning procedure what happens in our brain is
Constantly these ages and neurons are being adjusted and these new pathways are being created
That leads to a certain output or a decision
computers can also be trained in similar way where
neural network models are created and they are trained with a lot of training data and
the corresponding output and these neurons and these ages are adjusted and
The neural network becomes trained so that later on when you give a new input to machine
It can tell you the correct output
This is called deep learning and deep learning is one of the areas
Machine learning machine learning is a quite a broader term
It is a complete a science of field in computer science where we use various techniques and deep learning is one of them
there are other techniques where we
use
The knowledge present in available data, we extract it and use that knowledge to make our future decisions
so overall as I said before machine learning is a bigger area deep learning is one part of it and
There are like mathematical and statistical models that we use
To make predictions so that's another area
Machine learning has a big implication on our real life
One of the important features in any email account is spam filter if you are using Google or Yahoo
Or any other email account you will see that
They filter the spam emails automatically
The way they do it is they have seen a lot of spam
Emails in the past and they train machines to learn from the content of those emails and they filter it out for future
personal assistant type of devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google home is another example
they are getting increasingly better at
human conversation when you talk to them they
Learn your lesson. They learn your terminology and then in the future they
Give you an accurate reply for the question that you asked them
Youtube's recommended video is another example of machine learning where they look at your past pattern on
What kind of content you're watching and based on that they will generate the suggestions
Last but not least is driverless cars. I wouldn't be surprised if in next 10 years you will see
many tireless cars on the roads because
companies like Tesla Google uber they're investing heavily in driverless cars and all of them are using
Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are to make cars Martyr.
