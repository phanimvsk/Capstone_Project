a very simple
explanation of
neural network without using any heavy
mathematics in such a way that even
high school student can understand it
easily
let's say there is a group of students
who have never seen
koala in the life koala is a nice
cute looking animal from australia and
these students are very naive and they
have never seen this animal
and our job is to train this group of
student
so that you give them an image and they
will be able to tell you whether this
image has koala or not
you can make this a teamwork and give
individual responsibility to each of
these students
such as mike can work on detecting only
eyes
mohan can work on detecting only nose
so each of these students are working on
detecting a specific
part of koala's body from an image
the way they give their decision is by
using a score of 0 to 1
where 0 means this is definitely not
koala's eyes
0.5 means yeah it looks like koala's
eyes i'm not sure
maybe 50 50 1 means it is definitely
koala's eyes
once these students are trained and we
will look into
how exactly you can train them that is
also very important part of neural
network
but that will cover in the later part of
the video but for now just assume that
these students are trained
to detect specific uh part of koala's
body
so mike has become now expert koala
eye detector similarly mohan is an
expert koala
nose detector when you give them an
image of
a lion mike will say
the decision is point zero three because
the eyes
they are like round eyeballs but they
don't look like koala's eyes so
0.03 similarly for nose he can just give
some score and if the score is more than
0.5 we'll say yeah
those are koala's eyes or nose you can
extend this collaboration further
and make shakib an ear detection expert
and then these three students can go to
serena and serena can work on
deciding if the image has koala's face
or not
so once mike mohan and sakib says that
this image has koalas eyes nose and ears
saturna can use uh their work
to figure out if the image has koala's
face or not
and she can use a formula like this
because
if you look at koala the nose in koala
is very prominent koala's nose are very
are different than other animals so if
there is a prominent feature
then you can give that more weightage
and serena can derive this formula for
detecting the phase
and based on the scores that mike mohan
and saket gives
she will simply use this formula and
tell you
whether the image has koala's face or
not for example in this particular case
i have given sample a scores by each
individual person
and serenade computes the face score to
be 0.79
so if anything is more than 0.5 it means
it is koala's face
similarly if there is lion's image you
will see that based on the score
the face code will be 0.15 which means
it
it is remotely looking like
koala's face here
you can now use rest of the group uh
where they
individually for example jyoti can
detect legs and
chain can detect tail and they can tell
their decision to nidhi whose job is to
say
whether uh the image has koala's body or
not
and finally serena and nidhi will go to
sergey who will give the funds final
answer
and he will also use some kind of
formula here i am giving more weightage
to face
because when we are working on face
detection either humans or animals
you know when we are working on
detecting whether
it has humans or which animal we give
more weightage to face
so now this group is doing this awesome
teamwork
and telling you whether the given image
is koala's image or not this is nothing
but a neural network
each individual person here are
individual neurons
and they are working on a specific
subtask
and they pass uh the result of their
subtask to the next group
so serena and nidhi are actually uh in
terms of neural network they are a
hidden layer
mike mohan etc they're forming the input
or the first layer
and sergey is the output or the last
layer
so this is a neural network it's a
trained neural network
now the most important thing about
neural network is
how do you train it and how do you
detect these features
so just imagine that these students
are not trained right now you put all of
them
in a classroom and then you supply
an image to this classroom
and they will initially make a random
guess so mike will randomly guess
whether this image has koala's eyes or
not
and similarly everyone will make a
random guess
and finally sergey will tell whether
this is koala or not
and once sergey has a decision he will
go out
out of the classroom and there is a
supervisor
who is standing the supervisor knows the
correct answer
so sergey will say hello sir this
doesn't look like koala
and supervisor will be like no you're
wrong
this is koala sergey then goes back to
the classroom
and says hey guys this is actually koala
what score
did you give me serena and nidhi will
then go back to
rest of the classroom and say hey mike
mohan sakhib
this is actually koalas ears eyes and
nose you need to be careful next time
so they use this experience
of mistake so basically as a group they
made a mistake
and the mistake or the error has been
passed from
sergey to serena nidhi to the rest of
the group
this process is called backward error
propagation
so you make a mistake and then you
get the feedback that you have made a
mistake and you
pass this feedback to rest of the group
so that they
adjust their weights you can take
n number of koalas images and repeat the
same process
so the same process is repeated where
you make a random guess
then sergey goes out and tells the
supervisor that this is koala or not
the supervisor will tell you if the
answer is correct or not and the
error feedback is passed on to rest of
the group
and the group keeps keeps on adjusting
their weights
or adjusting their brains in a way that
they can finally come up with the right
answer you can be given
thousands or ten thousand such koalas
images and after
training this group for so many images
eventually
the group becomes better at koala's face
detection
initially it will make a lot of error
but as the time
goes it will keep on improving now
how it improves the weights for that it
uses
our derivative and some mathematics and
for that
i am going to link a popular video by
three blue one brown
where he has explained nicely how neural
network works so if you are interested
in looking at math
please look at that video the motivation
behind neural networks came
from the way human brain works if you
remember those days when as a kid you
were trying to learn bicycle
you would initially fall down then you
try again again fall down try again
and eventually you master that skill
during those trial and errors what's
happening
is our brain has billions and
maybe trillions of neurons and in those
neurons this training process is
constantly going on so there is this
error
loop or a back propagation feedback that
goes inside
those tiny neurons and the weights
between those neurons are constantly
being adjusted
until you get into a situation where you
are making minimum amount of mistake
right now when you are learning deep
learning actually
inside your brain there is a deep
learning going on
isn't that amazing if you have little
software engineering background and if
you reflect on our previous presentation
on koala's image detection
you might argue that this looks more
like a distributed computing
where each individual person mike mohan
said and etc
are working on a well-defined task and
their results are being aggregated at
the later stage
and it is okay to think that way but
that is not the most interesting
part about neural network the most
fascinating aspect about neural network
is the training itself imagine that you
are
not telling each individual students
what they should be working on
and these guys although they are naive
they
figure out in a smart way what
exact subtask they need to work on or
what exact feature
they need to work on that is the most
interesting part about neural network
and there is a mathematics involved
behind that which will look into it in a
later video
but in the real life when you are
dealing with a complex data sets
you do not know what features you are
looking at so you just
build a neural network which has input
layer couple of hidden layers
and the output layer and neural network
will figure it out for you
so each individual neurons are so
smart that they will figure out what
subtasks
they need to work on all you need to do
is you need to give a lot of
data to it i hope that clarifies some of
the doubts that you had about neural
network.
