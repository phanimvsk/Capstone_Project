[["Say, Jim, How about going for a few beers after dinner?", "You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness.", "What do you mean? It will help us to relax.", "Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time?", "I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.", "I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.", "That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.", "Sounds great to me! If they are willing, We could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, Too.", "Good. Let's go now.", "All right."], ["Can you do push-ups?", "Of course I can. It's a piece of cake! Believe it or not, I can do 30 push-ups a minute.", "Really? I think that's impossible!", "You mean 30 push-ups?", "Yeah!", "It's easy. If you do exercise everyday, You can make it, Too."]]
