I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.", "You'Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?", "Well, The thing is, We ran into a lot of problems...", "I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time!", "I know, And I apologize for the delay. But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, And then Michael was sick for three weeks, So I couldn't include him in the photos, And the design team lost all the files, So I had tore-do the pictures.", "I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAP!"], ["Yes, Sir?", "Can I have Mr. J. Smith paged? He said he'd be in the main dining room. I'm Mr. J. B. White.", "Who would you like to have paged again, Sir?", "Mr. J. Smith.", "Where would you like him to come?", "To the front desk.", "Just a moment, Please."]]
