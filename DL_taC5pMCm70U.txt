In computer vision, image classification
is not the only problem that we try to
solve.
There are two other problems that we
solve using computer vision, which is
object detection and image segmentation.
In this short video, I will explain you
the difference between these three using
a simple example.
For image classification you try to
classify entire
image as one of the classes, for example
is this
a dog or not. Image classification
with localization means you not only
classify the image as one of the class
but you
find the location of that object within
the image.
So this is called image classification
with localization.
If you have multiple objects in your
image such as
cat and dog, you might want to find their
location
and you can try drawing these
bounding boxes or rectangles specifying
the location of these classes.
This is called object detection. In the
image,
you're trying to detect an object, which
in this case is
cat and dog and you're drawing these
bounding boxes
or rectangles, so this is object
detection.
You can go one more level up and
classify each pixel
as one of the classes. For example, here
all the red pixels belongs to dog and
yellow pixels belongs to cat.
This is more fine grained classification
where you're exactly specifying
each pixel belonging to each class.
So just to summarize when you classify
the entire image as one of the classes is
called Image Classification.
When you detect the objects within an
image
with rectangular bounding boxes, it's
called Object Detection;
and when you classify each of the pixels
as one of the classes
it is called Image Segmentation.
Image Segmentation is little more
involved, I just gave a very simple
definition of it.
The the image segmentation which, I
showed you is called instance
segmentation.
There is semantic segmentation as well
but for this video just to keep things
simple
you can leave this, with this
understanding,
and I hope you like this video and I
hope you are enjoying this deep learning
series.
In the furthest further videos we'll go
more into object detection image
segmentation and we'll try to write
python code
using tensorflow.
