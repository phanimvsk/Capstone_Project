
hello everyone so welcome to this data science roadmap and in this session i'm going to talk about how to do a
preparation for a data science uh data science is one of the hottest skill you can say uh nowadays
and most of us are trying to prepare for a data science industry but some of us are able to make a transition
or we are able to get into a data science industry easily and some of us
are facing uh some sort of issue and yes that is that is very very common and it happens with all of us nothing new right
so not even a data science so let's suppose if i'm trying to uh get into any other industry so for sure i'll have to do a
preparation and according to my industry i have to adopt a couple of things i
have to learn couple of things and i have to do a couple of projects so here in this roadmap i'm going to talk
about that how to do that preparation what and all things are required what and all things are not required even if
things are required but till what extent we are not supposed to get a mastery
into each and everything this is not our industry expectations right for sure you all or we all will be able to work if i
know about a couple of things and this is something which i'm going to discuss in my data science roadmap i have
divided this entire things into a four segment so first of all i will be
talking about uh fresher so zero year experience to a two year experienced person how they will be able
to get into a data science industry and what in all kind of preparations they are supposed to do and then two to five
year five to eight year and eight plus year this is how i have divided this entire road map in a very clear way so
that you all will be able to get an advantage of these things and if you are
going to do a preparation according to these things which i'm going to discuss believe me
anyone will be able to get into this industry it's not tough the only thing is we have to structure ourselves we
should know that what we are supposed to study and what we are supposed to leave otherwise if you will just keep on
studying something uh there is no limitation right there is no limitation after some time you will feel
frustrated and you will say that no uh it's it's not it's not something which i can do but no that is not a fact
everyone can do it right either you you are from a tech background or maybe from you are from a dante background but
yes it is possible to do all of these things so fine guys let's talk about a
very first segment a junior data scientist let's suppose if i'm a fresher right
and if i'm willing to get into a data science industry then what in all preparations i'm supposed to do as a
junior data scientist here as you can see so in my slide i have mentioned that you are supposed to aware about a
computer science fundamentals right when i say computer science fundamental means about an operating system which is very
very important and i believe nowadays most of us are aware about it 90 plus people are aware about it a computer
science fundamental uh linux i have mentioned over here a basic terminal uses i have mentioned over here what is
api again not in depth just as an overview i'm supposed to aware about all
of these terms right so this is the only requirement that we have over here now
coming to this part now this part is very very very very important for all of
us as a fresher so if i'm a fresher i'll try to focus more and more on
programming and coding side even if i don't know about a programming or a
coding even if i have no interest in programming and coding but still that is
a requirement and here we have python one of the best
language one of the best library available so far on this planet to learn
it's very very easy as well as compared to a c c plus plus java scala or any
other languages you will be able to find out that python is one of the best and
one of the easiest possible language exists on this planet so it's not tough
to learn even if you are coming from a non-tech background let's suppose a civil background or mechanical
background i don't say that as a non-tech but yeah it's a people's perspective i'm just talking about it
right uh we we all have done let's suppose uh engineering or bca mca that's
completely fine right so at least we have studied some sort of a tech so i i just like uh keep every one
of them into uh tech itself but still there are some people who say that i'm coming from a non-tech background civil
mechanical electrical according to me it's tech so yeah
moving ahead so programming is important for sure so you are supposed to be aware about the programming now again if i'll
talk about a python programming so there are couple of library like python basic is important oops concept in python is
important logging exception handling modular programming all of these things
are very very important as we have mentioned over here object oriented programming numpy is important pandas is
important so all of these libraries are very very very very important again
whenever you are trying to do a coding whenever you are trying to learn coding always try to take a piece of data and
then try to do some sort of implementation some sort of exploration on top of those data this is the way to
learn programming because see again if i'll talk about libraries and of
functions or apis which is available inside a particular library so it's kind of ocean you will not be able to
memorize you will not be able to remember each and everything so the best possible way to learn any kind of a code
or any kind of a programming is just try to solve some sort of use cases
initially yes you are going to face a problem and yes we all face a kind of a problem every time right so whenever we
are trying to learn something new it's a human behavior it's a human nature right but still
if you are going to practice for a couple of weeks i'm not talking about uh years or maybe a six month or ten month
i'm just saying that if you are going to practice if you will keep on solving uh some sort of a problem on a regular
basis right some sort of a real problem on a regular basis so for sure you will be able to learn each and everything in
a best possible way and this is something that we have included inside your data science master's course which
is available inside your one neuron tech neuron segment so data science masters i
will be talking about it right so in data science masters course this is designed in a way that you will be able
to see each and everything in a similar sequences so let me show you so how this data science masters
curriculum looks like and where from where you will be able to learn this programming so here is a data science
masters if i'm going to search a data science master so this is the course that we have designed for you and let's
suppose if i'm going to click on any of these videos so here you will be able to find out a python basic you will be able
to find out oops concept you will be able to find out a concept of databases pandas numpy matplotli plotley c bond
edas so everything is already available and the way i'm going to discuss a
sequences so you can try to explore things in a similar way you can try to practice in a similar way and believe me
it's very very easy after doing a couple of week of like a practice so i believe
it's it's easy to do it now so here i have mentioned our programming language
as well but keep one thing in your mind either go for python or go for r
if i'll talk about industry so 95 plus people are using python programming
if i'll just talk about two segments r and python so if i'll try to do a comparison between i'm not talking about
all the languages so uh don't take me wrong over there so if i'll talk about a segment who is using either python or r
so it's 95 is to one so it's always better to go for a python and it's
actually very very easy right you will start taking an interest once you will start like solving some sort of a
problem with the help of python and you will find out that yes now it's very easy i can do it easily right so either
go for python or are not for a two programming languages at a
time i'm not going to advise you to learn a multiple programming language in a first place if you are able to learn
python and then if you are going to explore any languages right you are not
supposed to put up a similar kind of effort easily you all will be able to learn it it's very very easy because
syntax is the only thing which is going to change if suppose if i have learned python and then if i'm going to explore
java so it is not going to give you like a lot of pain you will be able to adopt you will be able to even write a code
and again you are not supposed to reinvent a wheel from a very scratch right so always try to focus on single
language that will be better now if i'll talk about uh query languages so sql
right so yes little bit of sql is required for sure because at the end of the day you
are going to deal with lots and lots of data set and that data set will be available in some sql system or maybe in
some no sql system or maybe in some file system so yes sql is important and you
are supposed to know a basic of it if you are fresher it's better it's better
to have an idea about a sequel so that you will be able to perform a multiple things you will be able to build an
application and you will be able to deploy something in a production server now coming to the next
segment right so here database fundamental i was talking about sql so yes database
fundamental is very very important because without databases you will not be able
to build any industry grade application anywhere believe me so that is the
reason this databases are very very important so i have mentioned a multiple databases
over here but if i'm aware about one equal system and
one no sql system that is more than enough if i'll talk about a sequel again
my sequel postgres sequel maria db db so sorry so like uh there are many databases
which is available so again you're not supposed to explore each and every database that's completely fine again if
i'll talk about a nosql so initially it will be better if you are having an idea about a mongodb again easy to learn easy
to explore this one right so one from a sequel and one from a nosql db you are
supposed to learn and again as and when it is required so let's suppose i have joined the organization and there is a
requirement for an implementation of a cassandra over there or maybe an hbase
or maybe a graph db so yes you will be able to do an implementation if you are
aware about at least one from this segment and one from other segment you will be able to explore and you will be
able to implement with no time so one sequel is very very important whenever
you are trying to interact with the sequel so always try to interact with a python api python is a powerful language
that provides you a driver that provides you an api to connect with any kind of a sql system and any kind of a nosql
system so always try to learn in that way and same thing we have discussed even inside your data science masters
again mastery is not required keep these things in your mind if you will think that first of all i'll
try to get a mastery into a sequel and no sequel and then i will move ahead my advice to you will be no it is not
required right if you have a basic understanding if you are able to consume
a data set from a sql system to your like a current machine learning system that you are going to build on a
statistical analysis system that you are trying to build that is more than enough and it's completely fine then coming to the next
segment as we all know that basic of mathematics is required right as a data
scientist and many people try to focus just on mathematics
that so again i'll give you one piece of advice over here that mathematics is required but not for all
job not for all job which exists inside a data science so
there will be another video inside this uh roadmap you will be able to find out so
where i'm just talking about a data industry so how data industry is divided so you can try to watch that particular
video and i think you will be able to get a neat and clean understanding about it so mathematics is required but again
a similar kind of a mathematics that we all have studied in our 9th and 11th or 12th right again not all kind of a
mathematics is required so basic of linear algebra algebraic equation right
a basic of calculus a differential calculus is required a basic of statistics and basic of probability so
these are the only thing which is required again don't think of doing a phds because math is again an ocean you
will just uh like keep on solving a mathematical problem but you will not be
able to get an end of it so it's better to have a basic idea about a linear
algebra a descriptive statistics in financial statistics probability right
or some sort of a calculus now these segments is going to help you out to
understand a machine learning algorithm theoretically and when you will try to
do a practical implementation right so these things these mathematics will help
you out to understand that whether i'm going into a right direction or i'm
going into a wrong direction when you will try to explore a data when you will try to build a relationship in between a
data even at that point of a time mathematical concepts are going to help you out and it's it's more like a
kind of uh i would say uh like uh exploring uh things it's more
like a kind of a building a perspective about the data so where this mathematical
things is going to help you out right now after this there is an instruction
that we have mentioned so once you are able to reach out to this till this label it simply means that that you have
completed python you have completed a db you have completed apis and you have completed a basic of mathematics part
now if you have completed a basic of mathematics part now you can start building your network so even these
piece of advice is mentioned inside your roadmap you can start joining a data
science community there are so many communities you will be able to find out over a linkedin uh over a facebook insta
everywhere you will be able to find out a multiple data science community now why i'm asking you to join a community
there is a reason behind this one the reason is very very simple so see
you are trying to get into our industry but you are not having any kind of idea that what i will be able to get when i'm
going to join this industry and that's true so when you will see a different people uh with a different different mindset a
different different geographical location with a different different perspective at that point of a time so you can start
building your own perspective that okay which one is required which one is not required uh you will start evaluating
yourself and this is where community is important you can start joining a data
science community you can start exploring a perspective of a different different people persons
and yes accordingly you can start talking about or data science or maybe
you can start exploring about a data science this is where this start joining a data science community comes into a
picture now here once you are done with a little bit of mathematical concept then you are
supposed to do what so then try to focus on data analysis now inside this data analysis you are supposed to learn
feature engineering data wrangling and then eda exploratory data analysis
and then you can start writing a article this part is again important so you can start writing article so that you will
be able to build your public profile building a public profile showcasing a
work to someone is very very important nowadays because let's suppose if i have a resume and if i'm not able to showcase
my work no one will be able to believe or no one will give me a call because uh
maybe like uh there is some alternate profile that they will be able to get where people
are showcasing all of their experiences all the expertise that they have so articles are very very important again
while you will write an article so when you will write an article so at that point of time uh you will be able
to see that yes i'm able to get some sort of a hold on top of a particular
topic and that is the reason so we have mentioned start writing an article section over here you can try to focus
on baby scrapping better scrapping is again important things because every time it's not like you will be able to
get a data in an excel seat or maybe in a csv or maybe in some other document it's like sometimes so we have to scrap
a data from an internet from some website from some server or something right at that point of a time bib
scrapping is very very important and yes we all are going to use bevel scrapping
even in our professional life so i believe you are supposed to aware about this baby scrapping things and which is
going to help you out to build your next project and to do a multiple things at that point of a time so that is the
reason so we have mentioned that okay fine so try to do uh bev scrapping and uh it is it is going to hit you it is
going to give you some sort of advantages in some way and then you can start talking about machine learning
now inside this masinali section so again we can try to divide these entire things into a multiple segment there are
hundreds of machine learning algorithm but you are not supposed to learn
mathematical concept and implementation for each and every algorithm there are some lists which i'll give you
so machine learning algorithm wise so yes there is something called a supervised machine learning there is
something called as unsupervised there is something called as like a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which is a combination of
supervised and unsupervised again inside supervised you will be able to find out regression you can find out a
classification again inside a regression there are a multiple algorithm inside a
classification again there are multiple algorithm so at least a basic algorithm
or a very very common algorithm we all are supposed to know again it's not like
these other algorithm you are going to learn maybe 10 set of algorithm you are going to learn and
you will be able to do each and every task for your entire life no that is not true but
why i'm advising you to learn only 10 there is a reason behind it so these
basic 10 algorithm let's suppose i'm aware about a linear regression a multi-linear regression
and then i'm talking so i'm aware about a polynomial regression i'm aware about a ris i'm aware about lasso in
classification segments so let's suppose i'm talking about uh like svm svr logistic decision tree
random forest so there are again multiple algorithm which you will be able to find out on this particular
segment classification segment so if you are aware about these algorithm it's well and good it's more than enough
you're not supposed to like uh think that okay fine so i'll not be able to explore i will not be able to understand
other algorithm no when time will come when it will be required you will be able to understand you will be able to
explore now there are some algorithm from a clustering site like a cabin clustering hierarchy clustering or
dbs scan so these are the basic clustering algorithm that we are supposed to know if i'm talking about a
dimensional reduction so pca ldas so tsne so these are the things that we are
supposed to know from this particular segment plus performance matrix is wise performs metrics for a classification
algorithm regression algorithm as well as clustering algorithm so we are supposed to know at any point of a time
which is very very important plus hyper parameter tuning so if i'm aware about a
couple of machine learning algorithm from this supervised unsupervised or semi supervised segment i'm well and
good so when i'm saying that you are supposed to aware about a machine learning algorithm i simply mean that
that theoretically mathematically as well as in a practical way
you are supposed to aware about all of these algorithm it's not like if i just know about the theoretical things about
a machine learning someone is going to give me a job no this that is not going to happen because people are going to
hire you companies are going to hire you so that you can productionize something you will be able to build or deliver
something to their client right so unless and until you are not going to explore these things still deployment
how to do a deployment how to host a machine learning model how to like do a
retraining and all those things how to build a complete pipeline for a machine learning implementation how to dockerize
this machine learning algorithm or how to build a complete ci cd pipeline for a
particular project i believe your knowledge is going to be a partial or it's going to be half so
you are supposed to focus on end to end deployment of a machine learning algorithm if you are just aware about 10
muslin algorithm that's completely fine no one is going to complain but if you know just uh if you know hundreds of
machine learning algorithm but just a theory of it it is not going to help you out right so 10 is better than 100 but
those 10 till deployment this is the expectations of a market
now after this for sure you will be able to get a confidence and you can start participating in a hackathon so again
there are multiple companies even i don't keep on conducting a hackathons right so you can start participating in
a hackathon and you will be able to win some of the hackathon i think that is going to boost your confidence for sure
right now there are like uh again machine learning algorithm which we have mentioned over there so you can try to
explore maybe ensemble technique or machine learning advanced technique a boosting approach time series again you
can try to explore with the help of machine learning you can try to build a machine learning recommendation system
you can try to like uh develop some sort of a recommendation system for some of the website or some
of the businesses that is completely fine now after machine learning so you can start reading a research paper if
you want again this is not mandatory but yeah try to explore some sort of a research paper and this is what we have
mentioned over there and then you can try to explore a little bit of deep learning
again deep learning is not required in very depth but it's better it's better to have it right it's better to have it
at least a basic of it again inside a deep learning there are multiple libraries which is available like a pie
torch keras or tensorflow so it's better to explore either of these libraries so
that you will be able to extend yourself for a next one and this is something that we have mentioned plus a little bit
of deep neural network rna lstm cnn this is the variance just an overview about
again i'm not saying that you are supposed to explore something in very very depth no if you're just aware about
it if you are just able to talk about it it's more than enough if you know something in depth if you if you have
that kind of interest please go ahead no one is going to stop you right but
if you think that okay fine so this is like a too much for me and maybe uh
like i will not be able to give this much of time it's completely fine you can stop yourself over here and then you
can start working on your profile and resume a building and as we have given you
a service right that you can come for a resume discussion so you can start
raising a request at this point of a time that okay i'm done with my study i'm done with my project right now i'm
able to deploy it i have done couple of the things now tell me how to build the resume you can come for a resume
discussions and we'll be happy to have you in our resume discussion one to one session at this point of a time and that
is our guidelines from i neuron now if i'll talk about a machine learning ops so yes tensorflow extend queue flow
amazon sagemaker these are nothing but it's a ops so operational site and a
little bit of these things is required so let's suppose if i'm trying to build a product so without these things i will
not be able to build a product i will not be able to host it on some server again so
docker kubernetes teraforms ci cd github action jenkins all these things are
required now if i'll talk about a cloud right if i'll talk about a cloud so you're not supposed to explore each and
every services which is available inside a cloud alone in aws itself there are more than more than 270 plus services
which is available now if you will uh like a start exploring all of these 270
services which is available which is provided by alone aws right it is going to take a huge amount of
time person is not going to hire you as an aws expert or cloud expert person is going to hire you companies are going to
hire you for a junior data scientist role so you are supposed to be aware
about a services which is required for your machine learning algorithm deployment and creating and building a
complete end-to-end system and that is my advice for all of you and these are
the only thing that you are supposed to explore now i'll show you your data
science master's curriculum so where we have covered each and everything in detail so here as i was talking about uh
python so yes python basic is there oops concept is there database is there pandas is there right numpy is there
matplotlib is there plotly is there c-bond eda biff framework python project
with deployment i was talking about a scrapper right so yes that projects are available over here i was talking about
a basic of mathematics yes those mathematics are available over here like i said many of us try to focus just on a
mathematics see uh study or learning is a never-ending process we will keep on
learning but our first priority is to get into a job if i'll just think that
that okay i'll get a mastery and then i will get into a job i think you will end up losing so much
of time so it's better to get into a job it's better to always focus on a things
which is going to give you a quick result right okay so here machine learning so again
all these algorithms has been discussed if i'll talk about a machine learning project there are so many machine learning pipeline based project which is
available if i'll talk about a basic of deep learning so yes all of these things are already covered so whatever is
required every and everything is available inside your dashboard itself now if i'll talk about your raising a
demand option so here you can raise a demand for a resume discussion so once you think that that okay i'm now i'm
good so maybe i can i can go for a resume preparation and i should start applying for the job now if i'll talk
about a mock interview right so yes uh you can come for a mock
interview with us and we are going to do an assessment and we are going to tell you that okay so this is where you stand
as of now and maybe in this area or that area you are supposed to practice a lot
coming back to this section so again to complete this section how much time is required on an average right so on an
average how much time is required for a pressure to do a preparation like i said technology is not tough
and again some people say that yes it is tough but yeah it's just a matter of time i would say
so here a time which is required to do this preparation is max to max a four
month right max to max four month if religiously you are involving yourself
if on a daily basis you are trying to do a preparation for two hour to three hour not more than two to three hour so two
hour to three hour for four months right so you can try to keep a
time for six months i would say six months so four month just go for the
preparation just try to do a preparation for four months right a complete hardcore preparation you can try to do
for a four month and then for next two months just go for a revision plus
resume tuning plus just a project building and just a mock interview that
is and that should be the strategy and this is how you will be able to get it in a easiest possible way
right that should be your strategy at any point of a time two to three hour for four months regularly and then next
two months just on revision because multiple things many things i would say or maybe
everything that you will be able to find out over here is going to be new for you we completely agree right and as a human
being so it's a nature that we will not be able to retain each and everything and we will not be able to like uh tell
each and everything and everything will not be on your fingertips right so it's better it's better to do a revision for
two months parallel to this you can try to work on your resume parallel to this you can come for a mock interview and in
this way it is going to help you out a lot so sixth month is maximum timing for
doing this kind of a preparation for a fresher more than this is not required
and each and everything is there inside your data science master's curriculum which i have shown you inside your tech
neuron dashboard that's it and any kind of a help that you need in between let's
suppose if you have a doubt or something you can raise a request over there and from our side so we are going to resolve
all of those doubt for all of you so with this uh thank you so much so hope you will try to spend at least a four
month of time plus two months for a revision and your final job preparation
as a pressure and hopefully it is going to help you out a lot and just let me know about
your feedback if i have to add something over here or if you would like to discuss something over here so based on
your feedback so i can try to modify and then uh maybe i'll come up with the latest version of it with that thank you
so much




















Data Science Roadmap For 2-5 Year | One Neuron
URL- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cfVOEyKSro
TRANSCRIPT-
all neurons so in this session i'm going
to talk about how to do a data science
preparation uh for a people who is
having experience more than two year or
in between two to five years
so
i've just like uh released a previous
video in which i was talking about
roadmap for a pressure so now this is
going to be an extension of the same
thing so here when i'll talk about a
senior data scientist because when you
have an experience in between two to
five year
there is a very high chance that
position wise they are going to offer
you a position as a senior data
scientist now what in all things are
required so again computer science basic
is required that is very very important
programming as i have mentioned in my
previous lecture
that
programming wise
at least one single language is required
and my preferred language will be python
because
if i know one single language for sure i
will be able to explore other languages
as well in the easiest possible way so
don't try to focus on a multiple
programming languages python itself is a
very very powerful language try to focus
always on a python programming
and
yes so
data structure algorithm now many people
ask me a question that whether data
stitch algorithm is required or it's not
required
let me tell you one thing very very
clearly over here
if you are going to start your career
with a product-based companies
so yes it is required even as a fresher
it is required even if you are getting
into a data science profile it is
required a basic of data stretch
algorithm linked list queue tree tree
traversal uh like a red factory like a
binary tree all those things are
required
now if you are going to apply for maybe
a
service based companies or some sort of
a startup in that case data switch
algorithm is not required so again make
sure of it it depends upon your
requirements so you can try to adopt
data algorithm or maybe you can try to
go ahead with the simple programming
again programming is very very important
side object-oriented programming modular
coding again inside a python multiple
libraries all those things are required
for a data processing as i have already
discussed in my
previous section of this video
now if i'll talk about a programming
technique so here you are supposed to be
aware about a design pattern so how we
can try to design an entire solution for
a particular problem that is something
which is very very important now if i'll
talk about a test driven deployment
again it is important so how you are
going to move your product or your
implementation from a development system
to a testing environment or to a
production environment dependency
injection so what in all dependencies
that you are going to face may be
improvised maybe a software device may
be solution code wise so yes that is
required functional programming is very
very important because without this no
one is going to accept your code in a
production environment and then database
fundamentals are very very important
because
at the end of the day you are not going
to keep your data set inside your local
system your data must be available in
some sql server in some file system or
maybe in some nosql system and hence
this database is required so you can
maybe try to explore a sql and then you
can try to explore one from nosql which
is a mongodb easy to implement easy to
understand and easy to consume these
things inside your code again i have
mentioned a multiple nosql db again
there is a huge list of sql and a nosql
db each and everything is not required
at any point of a time if you are good
with one i think you will be able to
crack an interview in the easiest
possible way so please make sure of it
and programming design pattern as well
as database these things are very very
important and please make sure that you
have and complete understanding about
these things when you are going to apply
for the job now coming to the next
section mathematics
again so don't try to like uh get a phd
into it so yes math is required but till
certain extent so not
like everything is required inside a
mathematics whether it's a linear
algebra whether it's a calculus whether
it's a probability whether it's a
statistics so a couple of things is
required and more important thing is how
to do an implementation right how i will
be able to use a particular things let's
suppose if i'm talking about a jet test
if i'm talking about a p value if i'm
talking about a b testing implementation
wise how i can utilize all of these
concept and all of these knowledges in
my development so this is how you are
supposed to understand a mathematics not
just in terms of a mathematical way
right uh just by solving some sort of a
simple problem no this time so you are
supposed to understand this methodics in
a way that you will be able to solve
some of the data related problem and
then you can start joining a data
science community because again
community is very very important here
you will be able to see a perspective of
our mindset of a different people and an
expectation of our companies and many
more things you will be able to learn
and these things is going to help you
out even to get a job right so start
building your com community but always
in a constructive direction not in a
negative direction so when i say
community i think we are supposed to uh
get an advantage of it maybe in a
positive way
now coming to our next section so here
data analysis again it's important it's
required right data analysis like a
feature engineering data wrangling edas
and then you can start writing an
article and then bib scrapping so like i
said in my previous section that some
time so you will not be able to get all
the data from your client and this is
where
scrapping is required sometime there
will be a data dependency there is some
sort of a derived data you have to
create now at that point of a time
scrapping helps us a lot to prepare
those kind of a data now you are
supposed to justify that how i will be
able to use and scrapping if you are
going to mention a scrapping project
inside your resume but yes
that is something that you are supposed
to understand now uh like coming to the
next section so indexation so machine
learning is important
obviously you are trying to prepare
yourself for a data science so
how you can leave a machine learning
without machine learning so you can't
become a data scientist that is like a
abcd of data science so yes machine
learning is required 10 algorithms i
believe not 100 but a way by which you
will be able to productionize those 10
algorithm you will be able to build on a
scalable system you will be able to do
everything that you want so in that way
you are supposed to learn a machine
learning algorithm
keep always these things in our mind
knowing just a theoretical concept or
maybe just a mathematical concept for a
machine learning algorithms are not
sufficient nowadays it's not relevant in
a current industry scenario because
let's try to assume uh one one case over
here so let's suppose there is a company
xyz and uh who is trying to hire you for
their like a senior data scientist
position or this particular role
and you're just aware about a
theoretical concept a mathematic concept
those companies will not be able to
deploy you they will not be able to
assign you any kind of a job any kind of
a portfolio because you have never
worked into a deployment you have never
worked into a scalability you have never
walked into a model retraining you're
not aware about it right
and that is something which is required
you have never you have never worked in
a pipelining
of any kind of a production grid
solution which is a requirement which is
a requirement of a particular project so
why they are going to hire you
just for a reason that you know some
sort of a machine learning algorithm
in a theoretical way they are not going to hire you they are going to reject
your profile they are going to reject
your resume so it's always better
to learn all of these algorithm till
deployment how i will be able to
productionize these things how in a real
sense i will be able to use it and this
is how each and every algorithm whether
it's a machine learning or machine
learning advanced algorithm so this is
how in that way you are supposed to
learn and then you can start reading a
research paper if you have an interest
because sometime in an interview so they
try to ask you a question saying that
that
what is the source of your knowledge
right so maybe you can give an argument
over there that okay fine so i keep on
reading a research paper i keep on
exploring multiple things by my side and
this is how i just keep on like uh
updating myself on a regular basis right
so this is where research paper comes
into a picture now
product wise yes it is very very
important there are so many projects
that we have given to you in your data
science master's curriculum
now
somewhere
data visualization is also important so
not all maybe just a w maybe just a
power bi maybe just a looker maybe just
a click view so at least one
you must be having a basic idea and
understanding about this w power bi
lookup click view any of these things
i'm not telling you i'm not asking you
that to get a mastery into each and
everything either of these is completely
fine to mention those things inside your
resume and that is going to increase our
weightage saying that that yes i'm a
person who knows how to build how to
deploy how to productionize a machine
learning algorithm i know how to play
with the data i know even a statistical
concept so if you are going to give me
some new challenges for sure i will be
able to solve it apart from that
i will be able to create a complete
dashboard right so where manager will be
able to see a stats they will be able to
visualize each and everything they will
be able to see a report and for a
reporting site these things as important
now so as a senior data scientist yes
there will be an expectations on a deep
learning side you are supposed to
available you can't say that no i don't
know deep learning i just know machine
learning i have already worked into a
machine learning and i'm just looking
for a machine learning profile because
nowadays almost every companies are
trying to explore trying to build a
solution by using this deep learning
which is again very very important and
you are supposed to learn a deep
learning concept this is important so
please try to make sure that deep
learning concept try to explore there
are a multiple vision algorithm you will
be able to find out nlp based algorithm
you will be able to find out or basic of
deep learning basic of a and that's more
than enough but yes please try to
explore those things and then you can
start building your resume this is
something that you should do
now computer vision so yes a little bit
like i have mentioned nlp a little bit
whatever algorithm that we have
mentioned over there so you are supposed
to aware about it
big data
so you are going to work as a senior
data scientist and let's suppose if i
have to ask you i have to assign you a
task for a pipelining
this is where this big data comes into a
picture a basic of big data is very very
important at least you must be aware
about a component like a pig hive kafka
spark airflow nifi all those solutions
and why we are going to use the solution
so that in an interview if someone is
going to ask you a question that are you
aware about this take a stack you can
say yes i'm aware about it and maybe uh
like uh
i can work if this task will be assigned
to me so yes that is important and
please make sure that you must be having
some sort of idea and we have already
given you a lecture inside your data
science master's curriculum now if i'll
talk about uh cloud computing again
cloud computing is required because at
the end of the day everything you are
going to host inside a cloud it can be a
aws azure it can be a gcp it can be some
other cloud but yes it is going to be a
cloud in majority of an environment in
missouri of a companies so cloud
computing is important to build into a
solution because you are going to work
as a
senior data scientist and without this
how you will be able to productionize a
solution into it you will be able to
build a solution plus machine learning
operation or ai ops we used to say or ml
ops we used to say somewhere so these
things are very very important we are
supposed to aware about an ops part so
that i will be able to use a docker
kubernetes or jenkins or maybe i will be
able to use our tfx and many more things
right
so please make sure that try to explore
uh ai offside or maybe a mlob side which
will give you a complete system design
perspective for any kind of ai system
that we are going to build and this is
something that we have mentioned over
there so like a model retraining
validations deployment scheduling
everything comes under the op section
again inside the op section so docker
kubernetes teraform jenkins all those
things comes into picture and cloud
services so
these this is the roadmap for a senior
data scientist which is an extension of
a junior data scientist itself not
talking about a time so if i'll talk
about a time how much time you are
supposed to spend so far sure if you are
going to apply for a senior data
scientist position so in that sense you
are supposed to spend at least three
hour two four hour
on an average on a daily basis for five
to six months
and apart from this so maybe you can try
to keep a buffer period of one to two
months
for your projects right for your resume
discussion for your mock interview for
your detailed project report creation
and a fine tuning of yourself you can
try to keep a buffer of like one to two
months so in seven to eight months it is
possible if you are if as an average
person so if you are trying to spend
this quality hours three to four quality
hours i'm telling you i'm not saying
that you're just sitting on a chair for
three to four hour for five to six
months and then it's it can happen no
the quality hour is very very important
if you are going to spend this much of
time it's easy to get a job as a senior
data scientist plus focus more and more
on project side and if you are applying
for a product based company focus on dsa
as well
data structure algorithm which is again
mentioned inside your tech neuron each
and everything which i'm talking about
is already available inside your data
science master's curriculum and you can
try to explore each and everything from
this tech neuron itself nothing will go
beyond it
plus
even interview questions we are like uh
we have already uploaded inside a 30
days interview question series plus
there is a github profile of i neuron
github like a link of iron where you
will be able to find out interview
questions and believe me no one is going
to surpass that particular label so you
can try to plan yourself accordingly and
then you can try to crack
this one and these things can these
things is possible so again i'm
considering a fact that we have started
from
zero right i'm not saying that you have
some sort of experience and then this is
going to work for you no i'm talking
about just a ground zero from where we
have started and then if i'm going to
start my preparation with this one
called as data science masters and
everything everything and
whatever whatever i have discussed
everything you will be able to find out
inside this section itself there is a
1100 plus video which we have uploaded
so it's a huge curriculum that we have
designed
just say machine learning deep learning
aiofs big data data analytics everything
projects and everything will be
available over it's already available
over here so please try to explore
according to your requirements and if
you are doing a preparation so from
today onwards you can start a
preparation create a chart create a
table saying that okay fine so i'll try
to invest three to four hour of time for
next five to six months and then last
one to two months i will try to expand
on a revision side on a mock interview
side on a resumer side and on a project
side because
learning is completely fine but learning
is not going to give you a believe me
your experience your expertise and a
capability to build a solution is going
to give you a job the kind of packages
that you're looking for the kind of a
profile that you are looking for each
and everything will come out of your exp
not out of your learning if you know
hundreds of machine learning algorithm
but you don't know how to productionize
even a single one believe me
one is going to help you
right so always try to focus on a real
thing
just try to maintain a habit
of like uh sitting on on a chair for
three to four hour
and that is something which can change
again
right so that is my advice to all of you
guys and hope you will do as it is as i
have discussed and keep on writing your
comments uh so if you have any kind of a
doubt any kind of a concern so for sure
i will be happy to clarify those things
with that thank you so much























Data Science Roadmap 5-8 Year Experienced | One Neuron
URL- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guwOATf9U-A
TIMELAPSE-
hello everyone so welcome to oneiron and
today i'm going to talk about how to do
a preparation so if i have an experience
industry experience again i'm talking
about so if i have an industry
experience of in between maybe uh five
to eight years so in that case how i
will be able to do a preparation so here
uh like uh yes computer science
fundamentals or maybe i will say like
operating system fundamentals is very
very important so i believe i'm supposed
to be aware about uh basic of linux
command that is pretty much obvious what
is uh uses of terminal or what is a rest
api
or what in all different different
frameworks which is available to create
apis plus a programming language again
programming language wise i will not
advise you to go after a multiple
programming language i think one is more
than enough
and the best one is python so it's a
very very powerful language and easy to
learn as i have mentioned in my
like a roadmap of afresha in a very
detail again inside a python programming
modular coding is important object
oriented programming is important a
couple of libraries are very very
important like a numpy pandas
matplotlib seaborn
cuff links all those things very very
important plus programming technique you
are supposed to know a design pattern
how to create a test environment uh
deployment dependencies and all those
things right so programming technique
wise because you
will be given a task to deploy to
productionize and to build a complete
system
uh there is a chances that if you are
going to join an organization as a lead
in that case you will be able to get
your team now you have to drive that
entire team so you should know all the
standard procedures and protocols
for example uh model coding right so
logging monitoring debugging right
everything must be like there you are
supposed to know about it you must be
like a
like a doing all of those things inside
your project apart from that the
knowledge of databases because yes
without databases you will not be able
to build anything in like anywhere right
so knowledge of sql system and nosql
system is very very important if it is
required so try to learn a multiple
sequels and a nosql system again
after some time you will be able to find
out that everything is same and it's
like if i can do if i can work in one
thing i will be able to work in other
thing so just try to learn in that way
and just try to build your perspective
in this particular fashion that would be
more than
now coming to a mathematical side so yes
uh sometimes so you are going to face
your client directly
sometimes so you will be taking a
business requirements right uh business
is going to in fact with you on a
regular basis they are going to assign
you a task they are going to check a
feasibility
of a particular task with you so yes you
must be aware about all the statistical
concept uh which has been used to
evaluate a project to evaluate a data
set plus a multiple mathematical expects
from a linear algebra from a statistics
from a calculus and from everywhere
so that you will be able to utilize
these things right you all will be able
to realize these things while evaluating
a data while doing an assessment for a
particular project for a particular
client so you are supposed to know about
a mathematics in a pure
like a in a way you know in a way by
which you will be able to use all of
these things in a real time that is this
is how you should learn a mathematics
let's suppose i'm just talking about uh
a b testing or if i'm talking about a
hypothesis testing if i'm talking about
a probability right
so it's not like if you are able to
solve a couple of problem in a
probability your work is done no how to
use these probabilities in a machine
learning in a deep learning in a
computer vision inside a nlp this is how
you are supposed to know about it this
is how you are supposed to adopt a
mathematics at this point of a time not
in a mathematical way but in a way
by which you will be able to explore
something out of the data something out
of the requirement given by your client
or maybe your team member so this is how
you should learn a mathematics always go
in a practical way when i'm saying
practical doesn't mean that how to
convert one particular like uh
like equation into a programming no that
is not a practical way i'm talking about
i'm just talking about a way by which
you can really implement it and then you
will be able to
like uh get some sort of insights out of
it that is a way by which you should
learn mathematics and then you can start
building your own data science community
i think that would be better you can
start guiding someone you can start
like interacting with the people who are
already a part of a data science
community uh because you will be able to
see a perspective from our different
different people and a person so this is
how you should
move ahead now coming to a data analysis
section so yes programming wise you are
supposed to do a data analysis but
always keep one thing in mind
always try to find out a logical
dependencies or a logical relationship
between a different different attributes
even inside your data this is how you
are supposed to do a data analysis
always try to focus on a business and
then try to understand a nature of the
data a particular business is trying to
generate which will help you out to
build a case in a strongest possible way
and you can present it in front of your
manager or in front of your client right
in a strongest possible way because
on this label
you will be uh you will experience some
time that uh it's not possible to build
a ai solution for every problem right
it's not possible
or sometimes so it's better to go ahead
with a non-ai solution as compared to a
ai solution because of maybe uh ease of
creating it or ease of like or maybe
because of a less number of dependencies
you will be able to get so it's not like
every time if someone is giving you a
problem statement we are supposed to go
in a ai way ai is just a tip right
maybe we can look for even a simple
solution right so instead of like going
ahead with the hard way so maybe we can
try to choose an easy one that is
possible so you are always supposed to
present your case and that case you will
be able to present if you are good with
an analysis of a data plus if you
understand a business
the kind of attribute that business has
assigned to you the kind of a columns
the kind of values that business has
given to you so based on that you have
to do a data analysis again it's a
broader one it's like a you have to
understand a broader picture over here
and based on that so you are supposed to
represent these things in front of your
client and then you can start writing
your own article based on your own
thesis based on your own analysis on a
daily basis that's completely fine which
will build a social profile for you
because on your label these things are
very very very very important right so
you can start writing an article baby
scrapping and all those things it's just
a part of it part of your job
so for sure you have to know anyhow
right now if i'll talk about machine
learning algorithms so yes you are
supposed to know about machine learning
algorithm at least 10 to 20 algorithms
from a supervised machine learning from
unsupervised machine learning from a
semi supervised machine learning site or
maybe from a design machine inside so
you are supposed to know about machine
learning algorithm again if i'll talk
about a sequence of algorithms so linear
regression and then like a polynomial
regression multi-linear regression risk
regression lasso regressions or maybe a
decision tree regression with the help
of decision tree or maybe a support
vector regressions there are so many
algorithms you will be able to find out
in a regulation site itself so yes you
are supposed to be aware about it now if
i'll talk about a classification
algorithm so maybe a logistic relational
algorithm support vector classifier
algorithm decision tree or maybe uh xj
boost boost or maybe
like a random forest so there are again
a series of algorithm that you will be
able to find out now knowing an
algorithm
and its mathematics and its theory is
good
but
it's not enough
it's not enough for a particular job if
you are just working as a researcher
maybe that is fine you can just keep on
doing a research on a mathematical side
on a stat side and it is completely fine
but as a person who has joined a giant
joined an organization and who is having
a task to deliver it
over here
so you are supposed to learn an
algorithm plus its implementation now
when i'm talking about implementation it
doesn't mean that that i'm just talking
about like a calling in garth passing a
data inside it like fitting up the data
inside the algorithm and then work is
done no
this is again not a way
right most of us have done that right
most of us have like a created a model
but it's of no use believe me
unless and until you are not going to
create a complete pipeline from your
extract transform and load plus building
an algorithm plus productionizing it
first of all into a development
environment then uat then into a
production unless and until you are not
going to build a complete pipeline for a
model retraining you are not going to
define a model retraining approach right
you are not going to build a system
which can work for one and which can
work for million right
i think your work is not done so you
have to focus you have to have focus
more and more on a system side
on a architecture side on a design side
as well you will be the one who is going
to decide that or you are going to
advise to your senior management saying
that that this is the architecture this
is the databases which i have used
whether it's a sequel or nosql
this is the cloud infra which i have
taken this is the services which i am
consuming this is the derived data set
which i have created
right so complete detail project report
you have to create by yourself and for
that you have to learn all of those
things you have to experiment and
explore all of those things on this
label right and that is the reason so i
have given you an advice that just
knowing a machine learning algorithm or
its mathematical term or theoretical
term is not enough at all right so just
try to explore these things beyond it
and everything is given to you in your
data science master's curriculum for you
guys or you guys who falls in between
this particular bracket
so the since your advice to all of you
is that focus more and more on
implementation side instead of
theoretical side
that will give you experience and that
is something which is going to work in
your interview if you are not focusing
on your practical side things will go
south believe me things will go south if
you think that that i just know about an
algorithm and mathematical term i'm good
with it and it is going to work no
always and always people will try to
focus on an implementation side and
again a core end-to-end implementation
till deployment till retraining approach
so just keep always these things in our
mind and then if you want you can start
reading a research paper if you want you
can start exploring a different
different kind of systems as well
now coming to a data visualization even
if you have not worked into a data
visualization but still you must be
aware about a connectivity you must be
aware about a basic of it right whether
it's a w or power bi or looker or click
view or any other dashboarding tool but
yes you are supposed to be aware about
it now if i'm talking about a deep
learning
deep learning is must for you guys
deep learning a basic is at least
important if even if you are going to
switch as a machine learning engineer
people must be having an expectation
that you are aware about a little bit of
deep learning so please keep these
things in mind that you have an idea
about a deep learning and with the
preparation you should go right okay now
coming to a computer vision so computer
vision again it's an ocean so you can
explore the entire syllabus that we have
given to you with the
use implementation almost every kind of
implementation is mentioned inside your
computer vision which is a part of your
data science master's curriculum if i'll
talk about nlp yes everything is
mentioned if i'll talk about a big data
yes everything is mentioned why we have
mentioned all of these components there
is a reason behind this the reason is
that
at the end of the day system is the only
thing which matters and you are going to
build a system
right so unless and until you are not
having an idea and understanding about
the whole system and its integration how
you will be able to build a system and
keeping these things in your mind we
have given you this entire huge
curriculum yes it takes time but
it's going to pay you a lot
so it's better to go ahead with a
preparation in a war so that you will be
able to
win it right so go for
win here cloud computing infrastructure
machine learning ops site again for you
guys it's very very important ci cd all
those things are important
now for
especially for a person who is going to
work as a lead i will try to focus on
this side
you will be engaged or you will be a
part of engaging a stakeholder your
client or a person who is going to
assign you a work right so you will be
responsible for deriving uh values
right identifying their need so maybe
you can propose them that okay fine so
maybe i can solve this problem in this
way maybe you can
bring a business for your uh like a
respective organizations right so even
you as a lead will be responsible for
exploring a new things creating a values
inside your company because your next
role is going to be a managerial role or
maybe
when whenever you will join a next
company so yes you are must be prepared
for these roles right so how in a best
possible way you can engage your
stakeholder how in a best possible way
you are going to introduce a new
capacity inside your team infuse on new
things inside your team how you are
doing a pocs rfps how you are going to
build an entire team how you are going
to reskill your entire team along with
yourself matters a lot on this
particular label so my sincere advice to
all of you will be to focus even on
these side right generally as a techie
so
we never try to focus on this side but
believe me if you are going to focus on
this side it is going to change your
life and it is going to right and it is
going to give you an open up
hell lot of opportunity in a market
right so please make sure that you do it
right you take a stick holding take a
ownership take a leadership and deliver
it
try to build a team build our
capabilities right so let's suppose you
have joined a team and over there so
they're just working on machine learning
try to set up a team who can even work
into a deep learning even work into a
computer vision even work into a
reinforcement learning
try to build a capability so that you
will be able to do a integration of your
existing system with any other system
and you will be able to do a maybe like
a
die to achieve a cost cutting try to
achieve a reskilling of the team and
there are so many activities that we can
do on a floor right on a daily basis so
always try to work as a team leader over
there
and
just try to build an awesome team over
there okay
so educate educate your team right and
again help assist each and everything
so that is a very very important and
this is something which i have mentioned
so build a complete data science culture
try to understand requirements of each
and every clients try to extract as much
business as possible and that is
something which is going to give you a
success now coming to now coming to our
dashboard so here inside this dashboard
each and everything we have given to you
right everything right from the
beginning so whatever is required to
explore to discuss to like uh experiment
right everything is available over here
you are not supposed to go anywhere and
if something is missing yes you can
connect with us and then we will try to
help you out but
try to explore this data science masters
in detail just try to spend as much time
as possible now time wise if i'll say so
time wise so maybe you can try to spend
so time wise you can try to spend maybe
right three to four hour which is
average i think that's more than enough
so
three to four
hours right maybe for six to seven
months and one to two months
you can try to take for a revision uh
for a resume preparation for your mock
interview for a project for a detailed
project report dpr and all those things
right so always always try to like a
work as per the given instruction and
easy to make a transition again you can
come for the resume discussions you can
come for the mock interview with iron
team so there is a razor demand option
which is given to you and just try to
utilize just try to take advantage of it
as much as possible
so hope this is going to help you out a
lot with this thank you so much and see
you
see all of you in my next lecture thank
you

hello everyone welcome to oneiron and in
this session i'm going to talk about uh
roadmap a data science roadmap for a
senior people or a data scientist for a
people who is having experience more
than eight years so in this session i'm
not going to follow a top-down approach
i'm going to follow a bottom-up approach
and there is a specific reason behind
this approach which i am going to follow
to explain a road map for this data
science for a senior people now just try
to understand in this way
that if i'm a senior a person if i'm
working as a manager or maybe if i'm
working as a lead or architect in that
case
right what will be my roles and
responsibility my roles and
responsibility will be to talk to a
stakeholder first of all
it is also a possibility that you will
be a stakeholder in your respective
organization means you will be
responsible for explaining you will be
responsible for deriving a new business
opportunities for your organization and
in that case you have to interact with a
lot of people on a daily basis apart
from this so let's suppose if you are
working on a technical side so for sure
you are the one who will be responsible
for designing the architecture system
release whatever you can say end-to-end
for every application so here top-down
approach is not going to work if you are
going to start learning a python then if
you will try to start like uh learning
machine learning then deep learning i
think that is not going to work and this
is not the approach that you all are
supposed to follow so first of all try
to understand that what kind of a role
and responsibility you are going to play
when you are going to join your next
organization so for sure as a lead as a
manager as a director as architect so
you all are going to like build a team
so yes for a organization for a current
organization so maybe i'm going to join
one company and
manager of like or maybe our directors
are going to ask me to build a team
maybe a company is trying to build a new
capabilities for a machine learning for
a deep learning for a computer vision
for a hardware ai based research or
maybe for a reinforcement learning so
yes that will be my responsibilities
finding out a right person for your team
will be an important task for you and
you have to build a team let's suppose
if you have a existing team so in that
case you have to think about a race
killing your existing team because
technologies are changing on a daily
basis again on a daily basis you will be
able to find out a new algorithm new
implementation a new tech stack so again
that will come on you for your company
so you have to bring a client because
unless and until you are not going to
bring a client inside your current
organization i believe your roles are
not going to be a relevant one so again
you have to work on a client acquisition
as well you have to bring a business
plus whatever business that you are or
whatever the stakeholding that you have
as of now so you have to deliver those
things on a daily basis maybe on a
weekly or monthly basis at a time so you
are not going to handle just a single
team so at a time there is a chance that
you will end up handling a multiple team
again multiple team for a data science
or multiple team which is from a data
science or maybe apart from data science
for example so let's suppose if i'm
trying to build a machine learning
solution so if i'm trying to build a
machine learning solution so it's not
like a solution you will be able to
build just by having a capability of a
machine learning engineer no big data
engineer is required someone is required
in on a dashboarding site someone is
required maybe on a website someone is
required on a platform site someone is
required on our off site someone is
required on an infrasight so there are
multiple teams that you need and you
will have to handle an entire team at a
at a time you have to build a flow you
have to build a process and a pipeline
so that you will be able to deliver
something so you're not supposed to work
just on one single thing plus you have
to derive a new solution on a regular
basis because that is a need that is the
need of our industry this is how market
is going to work and so
bottom up approach you are supposed to
follow so first of all you are supposed
to know let's suppose i'm trying to get
into a healthcare domain or maybe into a
supply chain domain so i'm supposed to
like uh know first of all in a very
first phase that
what kind of a solution is possible in
ai at least some because there are
millions of there are infinite number of
solution you will be able to find out in
or out of the organization but in a
beginning itself you are supposed to
know about it because people is going to
ask you a question you know interview
that how many projects you have
delivered what is the kind of a business
that you have bring inside the company
what is the total profit what is uh like
a number of clients that you have
handled so far so forth how many number
of people you have handled so far so
forth and what is a diversification of
that particular team so these are the
question when comes in a first phase so
why we are not supposed to start from
that particular area so if i have to
apply for a job i'll start exploring
these areas what is a solution now once
i will be able to understand that okay
so x y z kind of a solutions are
possible in this respective domain then
i will start exploring about a
technology and here if you can see
right so this is what i have mentioned
in this particular slide so i'm trying
to state over here that okay so let's
suppose if i'm trying to like a build or
if i'm trying to do something so here
architect role wise so i'm supposed to
focus on architectural drivers so what
in all requirements what in all
technology from a different perspective
i'm supposed to learn then a technology
selection designing the entire solution
then evaluation of the entire
architecture quality assurance coaching
and mentorship again this is going to be
your part so i'm supposed to focus on
all of these things building a right
team with a right people right number of
people in a like a timeline that is
given to you again that is a crucial
task that we all used to play on a
senior label
and you have to design a process process
for a delivery process for reskilling
process for handling a team process for
generating a new business so everywhere
you will be involved now the best part
or the best way to explore these things
is with the help of this particular
course which is available over here
called as dsar data science architecture
and resume so this is a session which i
have delivered last year it's a bit
lengthy session you will be able to find
out but again at the same point of time
it is going to be an interesting one i
have received many feedback many comment
from a multiple people saying that yes
it is very very effective and it has
helped me a lot so first of all try to
understand a design first of all try to
understand architecture now if i'm going
to talk about this part two you will be
uh able to understand that here i have
discussed about one of the problem and a
design and the solution which
we have created when i was working for
xyz company right so here you will be
able to see a conceptual architecture as
well as you will be able to understand a
technical architecture which i have
discussed in a very very detailed way
you will be able to understand a
business problem and its respective
solution and that is the reason so i had
created this dsar architecture classes
right through ysa data science
architecture and resume discussion
classes i have given for a community
last year so for you it's a very first
the very first thing that you are
supposed to explore is this one dsar so
please try to start from here please try
to understand that what you are supposed
to do and what you are not supposed to
do
this is fine so forget about technology
forget about everything right because ai
is nothing but it's a set of technology
by which you can solve a problem in
every domain
without any exception without any
outlier you can solve we all can solve
it so please try to go through this one
now coming back to this one
right so now let's suppose if i'm aware
about right if i'm aware about the
entire things what i can do what i can't
right if i'm aware about the
architecture i'm aware about the
solution designing i'm aware about the
client business problem and my team
right so each and every process is set
then maybe we are supposed to look into
a tech side now in some company if you
are going to join as a manager maybe
these things are not required but yes in
some company so it is required
especially in product based company so
yes you must be having a business
understanding the understanding which i
was talking about apart from this so you
are supposed to be aware about a
technology so it would be better if you
can start again with the bottom up
approach so try to learn try to talk
about first of all infrastructure how i
will be able to utilize those
infrastructure for like a ml solution
for a python solution for a vision
solution for a s device solution and all
sort of things so in this way if you are
going to learn
offside infrasight because that is going
to give you a broader view
and that is important for a senior
people unless and until you are not
going to understand a broader view a
high label design you will not be able
to implement a low level design at all
because you are the person who will be
responsible for designing this solution
you will be the person who is going to
make it or break it everything over here
in an organization you will be the one
based on
based on whose instruction entire team
is going to work so if you are the one
who is not aware about these things how
your team is going to work how your team
is going to deliver that is not possible
and that is the reason so i have asked
you that try to follow a bottom up
approach try to look into this one and
then you are supposed to explore this ai
ops course
which is available over here ai ops
course is very very important for all of
you especially for architect especially
for seniors so after dsar you are
supposed to get into these things these
entire things so that right so that you
will be able to understand a complete
infrasight in a detail and a depth way
because coding is fine so more or less
uh amount of coding is completely fine
if you are aware about something uh like
a coding or maybe you're not that that
is a secondary thing but infra
architecture design business clients
these are the things which you should
focus on in a very very first place and
this is something that you are going to
mention inside your resume then
if i'll talk about a specialization
right so let's suppose if i'm aware
about the offside if i'm aware about
each and everything then
as an overview again you are not
supposed to go in depth i'll not suggest
you so you should know almost everything
but not
mastery into each and everything yeah
with a timeline for sure you will be
able to get a mastery but as you are
trying to make a transition and if you
will invest your time
like most of the time just to cover up a
beginning maybe a python maybe a stats
maybe ml algorithm in that case you will
feel like a frustrated because as a
senior people so we have a different
different responsibility uh family
responsibility or maybe in office so we
have so many different different kind of
responsibilities and it is going to
create a pain so just to remove that
particular pain try to understand first
a design architecture solution whether
it's possible whether it's not so once
you will start talking about or you will
be in a position to talk about a 10
different different solutions right for
sure you can discuss about it in your
interview and that is going to
like uh that is going to be a point for
you where you can crack an interview and
is in the easiest possible way right
this is what i have seen from my
experience right and i'm just trying to
share my experience with all of you
that's it
so here then you can come for the resume
building and then slowly gradually so
you can start exploring all of these
things whether it's a language again not
in depth maybe as an overview maybe
machine learning algorithms so maybe
like a databases maybe like an analysis
part maybe a big data site so you can
start exploring each and everything
after that one so that is something
which is going to like give you a
capability to make a transition again
i'm going to summarize each and
everything right so summary wise first
of all you are supposed to look into a
very first thing called as dsar again
it's a lengthy session but i believe you
will enjoy it for sure now the second
thing is you are supposed to look into
ai ops the third part is you are
supposed to look into a data science
master's program right data science
master's program so you can just look
into it and just try to take an overview
i'm not saying that go in depth practice
each and everything solve all the
assignments solve all the problem and
then go for the job no
it is going to create an headache for
you so it's better move in this way so
that you will be able to get a point to
discuss plus a broader overview and idea
and understanding you will be able to
get and then go for the 30 days
interview preparation because there's 30
days
interview preparation so i have already
discussed about so many questions
hundreds and hundreds of questions
multi-hundred questions is already
discussed even architecture and designs
are discussed over there so that is
going to help you out a lot
in a short term as well as in a long
term i hope uh you are able to
understand that what you should do and
what you are not supposed to do right
and yes after that come for the resume
discussion come for a mock interview
uh come for the
assessments and we can we can tell you
over here that okay fine so here you are
lagging and here you are clear and you
can you can move ahead this is my advice
and this is my data science roadmap for
senior people with that thank you so
much see you again in my next lecture
thank you

hello everyone welcome back and today
i'm going to talk about a data
engineering roadmap let's suppose i'm a
person and who is trying to get into a
data engineering site or maybe i'm
trying to join some organization i'm
trying to make a transition into some of
the organization as a big data engineer
so how i'm supposed to do a preparation
because there was a time when i was
like uh going through a similar kind of
a situation seven or eight years back so
when i was trying to do a transition
from sap to big data so because of this
lack of road map lack of resources i had
struggled a lot so i thought of creating
this particular video so that it is
going to help you out a lot
and for sure we all can do a transition
into a data engineering site if and only
if we are going to work really really
hard for couple of months not for a year
not for a decade just for a couple of
months so listen out entire stack
carefully try to do one by one each and
everything that i'm going to discuss and
then for sure you will be able to make a
transition after your hard work so let's
suppose if i'm trying to join some
organization as a data engineer or big
data which is for sure a need you can go
to linkedin and you can try to check how
many number of job opportunities are
available and for sure it's very very
high it's in a lag so as a data engineer
or as a big data engineer there are so
many opportunities which is available to
all of us so let's suppose if i'm trying
to get into a data engineering site so a
very first thing which i will try to
focus over here is i will try to
understand hadoop so if i'll talk about
a number one so it's going to be
hadoop
hadoop is very very important it's a
distributed file system which is called
as hdfs hadoop distributed file system
which has been derived from gdfs a
google file system or google distributed
file system gfs file system so hadoop
and
and a concept behind what is our meaning
of distributed computation what is the
meaning of a parallel computation so all
of these things are very very important
so you are supposed to understand an
architecture behind a hadoop system
unless and until you are not going to
understand this architecture behind a
hadoop system it is going to create an
issue in your interview so you are
supposed to understand a complete
distributed computation system
architecture just an architecture try to
understand now so five or six years back
or seven years back when i was trying to
do a preparation so at that point of a
time even map reduce is import map
reduce was important but nowadays map
reduce is not important so you can just
try to skip that particular part because
nowadays no one is using map reduce at
all so after hadoop so if i'll talk
about seven year back so we used to
study a map reduce and we used to do a
coding by using maybe a java maybe by
using a scala but nowadays map reduce is
not a relevant one because there are
some powerful engine which is available
in a market which can work much much
better than a mapreduce and that too in
a very optimized way so you are not
supposed to touch map reduce again if
i'm talking about a hadoop distributed
system so maybe you can go ahead with a
2.x or 3 dot x so try to study these
system try to study a resource manager
like a yarn or resource this kind of a
resource manager you are supposed to
understand try to understand how
replication factor will be implemented
try to understand again a multiple
component which comes under hadoop
itself so what i'm trying to say over
here is a complete hdfs file system you
are supposed to understand now when you
are trying to understand this hadoop
system a hadoop ecosystem
right at the same point of a time you
can try to explore and you can try to do
a practical implementations as well by
using maybe a cloud data distributed
environment or maybe by using the hdp
hortonwork distributed platform so you
can try to use cloud data or you can try
to use hdp hotend work nowadays now both
are same so you can try to use either of
this and then you can try to each
implement each and everything so in this
way for sure you will be able to get a
practical implementation of this entire
hdfs file system it's just a file system
so no need to worry about it but
at the same point of a time a second
thing which is important is a basic of
basic of
linux
command again this is important because
when you are going to deal with the sdfs
system at that point of a time so for
sure you are supposed to know so how to
copy a file from one part to another
path so how to start one services how to
stop other services how to create a
directory and many more things is
important again i'm not asking you to
get into a depth of it if you are aware
about uh like a detail of a linux system
and its command that's completely fine
but at least a basic of a linux command
is very very important so just make sure
that you know all of this basic command
at least 2025 number of commands and
then it's okay okay to go ahead with a
different different component which may
come into our picture now a very third
thing which i would like to recommend
you over here is a language
so language wise you can opt for
three languages again you can opt for
more but what i will advise you is to go
ahead with either of these languages so
maybe
a java maybe
scala or maybe you can go ahead with
python many of us think that that java
can be a complex one a complex to learn
complex to implement that's completely
fine scala may be a complex one complex
to learn complex to implement so in that
case you can opt for a python because
nowadays whatever system that you are
going to use whatever services that you
are going to use you can and you will be
able to find out a python apis and
python library for each and everything
so just make sure language is a enabler
it is going to enable you to write a
code it is going to enable you to design
a system but nothing more than that so
you are going to offer java scala or
python that's completely fine either of
these things are going to work for you
and for sure you will be able to do an
implementation but yes don't
miss a language part because if you are
going to join any organization on a
technical side you can't miss the
language part at all that is very very
important believe me so you are supposed
to understand and you should know a
language path at least till a
intermediate label i'm not asking you to
get a mastery into any of the languages
but at least till intermediate path you
are supposed to understand a language
side now a next thing which i would like
you to understand
for this data engineering part is
a high
so again hive is a very important tool
for a data warehousing which is an
integrated part of your hadoop ecosystem
whenever you are going to install
so like let's suppose if i'm using a
cloud database distributed environment
or maybe emr if i'm going to use or
maybe i'm going to use hot and work so
in all of these environments you will be
able to find out hive which is installed
if you are going to do a custom
installation
so yes hive as a service you will be you
are supposed to install separately but
again that's that's it's mentally and if
a person is having an idea about a
sequel a basic of sql command so in that
case
you will be able to understand hql hive
query language in an easiest possible
way again it is not going to give you
much pain because it's almost similar to
sql i'm not saying that it's exactly as
sequel but yes command wise syntax is
wise if you are unable to understand sql
i believe you can learn all of these
things easily and again you will be able
to do a comparison as well in between
hive and a sequel so where i'm supposed
to use hive or where i'm supposed to use
a sequel and easily you will be able to
do an implementation so hype is very
very important if i'm talking about a
data engineering site because almost in
every project we are using hive you
won't be able to find out even a single
project where we are not using hive or
its equivalence so everywhere it is been
used so just keep these things in our
mind that i should know hive now some
people say that even pig latins are
required but i will not recommend you a
big latin because in today's environment
pig is not required so yes a seven year
back when i was trying to learn so pig
was important believe me at that point
of a time so in every interview people
use this to ask multiple commands from
this side but nowadays don't worry no
one is going to ask you any kind of a
question on a big site right even a
theoretical or practical no one is going
to ask you at all so just chill out and
uh don't take attention about this big
things now
uh if i know hype so for sure i will be
able to understand uh impala so again
impala is almost equivalent to a hype
and it's not a big deal to learn impala
at all so it's equivalent to high and
hype is almost equivalent to a sequel
again command-wise not architecture and
design-wise so it's been used for a
different purposes for sure but yeah you
will be able to understand in the
easiest possible way now the next thing
that you are supposed to know is that
fifth number thing is uh maybe flume
scoop
or maybe
you can try to learn knife
so plume scoop and nifi so all of these
tools are nothing but all of these
services are nothing but which has been
is been used for doing a data transfer
from one system to another system so
just for transferring a data let's
suppose i'm supposed to transfer data
from a sequel system to oop this hadoop
system so in that case maybe i can try
to go ahead with the scoop if i'm
looking for a file transfer i can try to
look for a flume if i'm looking for
every kind of a transfer so i believe
nifi is a beautiful and powerful and
light-weighted tool which is available
in a market and yes i will try to go
ahead with a apache an i5 or maybe a
scoop or maybe a flume so all of these
three tools are required these three
technologies are required on your
like a data transfer site so data
warehousing site hive is required
language wise java scala or python
either of these
you can pick and choose basic objects is
required hdfs system is required fluid
scoop and nifi is required on this side
again if i'm talking about a database
site
nosql database site so hbase is very
very important database it's a very very
important believe me so you are supposed
to understand this edge base unless and
until you are not going to understand
hbase so it is going to create a lot of
problem for you so make sure that you
should know hbase it's been used on top
of hdfs file system and it is going to
give you so much of advantages when you
will try to draw or when you will try to
build a dashboard on top of your final
data set or whenever you are dealing
with a lot of financial data set and you
are trying to do a data search based on
the indexes so hbase is again a very
very important tool which is required or
it's a nosql based database which is
required for all of us
now if i'll talk about maybe a seventh
stack over here which is a very very
important stack that you are supposed to
know is called as s p
a r k it's a in memory computation
enzyme a very powerful one
right a very powerful
in memory computation engine and that is
a spark and a spark there are so many
advantages you will be able to see you
will be able to get with respect to a
spark so here you will be able to find
out maybe a spark and a spark sql spark
for the streaming spark machine learning
libraries spark even nlps are available
from a snowflake lab so again there are
multiple variants of spark which you can
try to find out for example so spark sql
or a spark ml lib you can try to find
out a spark
streaming you can try to find out so you
are supposed to know each and everything
now let's suppose if i'm aware about
spark and again a spark provides you a
flexibility to write a code by using a
java scala python or our programming
languages some of the apis are not
available in our programming languages
but yes languages are just a language
like i said it's just an enabler it is
going to give you a capabilities to
maybe replicate or build a system right
so it's completely fine doesn't matter
for me which language i'm going to pick
and choose the concept is very very
important
and here a concept of a core spark
concept of spark sql ml lib streaming
all of these things are very very
important now the eighth part which i
would like to highlight over here is a
scheduler side so scenario wise you can
try to use maybe a
ug or you can try to use
airflow
so oozy is a xml based scheduler so by
which you will be able to schedule a job
at a particular time stamp and then it
is going to run a job in an automated
way and uh ooji is basically a xml based
xml based file system based scheduler
that you can try to find out and any
kind of a job if whether it's a linux
job whether it's a spark related job
whether it's a hype job whether it's a
flume job a scoop job
you will be able to schedule with the
help of og and its alternative is an
airflow so airflow provides you a flavor
of python so here you can try to write
your script not in an xml file but
instead of writing a script in xml file
you can write your like a complete
scheduler by using just a airflow by
using a language python right so nothing
can be more amazing than that so if i'm
working with python i believe i will be
like a choosing i will be going for like
a airflow which is which is anyhow going
to my preferred choice so uj and airflow
this is what you are supposed to know so
these are the technology stack which is
very very important it's a bare minimum
technology stack which is required now
if i'm going to talk about another stack
so yes uh for streaming purposes you
need kafka kafka is again important
nowadays
kafka is very very important if you are
looking for a streaming right and kafka
and spark integration and scheduling
those things with the help of ooji and
airflow so nowadays we are almost using
this kind of a stack everywhere in our
market in almost every project every big
data engineering project so we are
trying to use it so yes kafka is
important and again architecture of
kafka is very very important
implementation creating a producer and
like a consumer is very very important
and multiple consumers are very very
important and dealing with a streaming
data set a batch data set or maybe a
mini batch data set is very very
important so all of these things you are
supposed to know anyhow so this is a
bare minimum requirement guys
unless and until you are not aware about
all of this stack it is going to be
difficult for you to get into a data
engineering site a bare minimum
requirement believe me hadoop basic of
linux any one language hive floom scoop
nifi either of this hbase spark inside
spark sequel mlm streaming uj airflow
from a scheduling site and kafka from a
streaming site so all of these stacks
are important now let's suppose if i'm
aware about all of these stacks then
what i will do is then i will go ahead
with the resume a
discussion
so yes in your one year on platform
resume discussions is already available
so you can raise your request by using a
one-year-old platform and you can come
for the resume discussion but before
coming for the resume discussion you are
supposed to do our projects because
inside your resume what you are going to
write your experience and your projects
now if i'll talk about a project so
always try to build a pipeline based
project so pipeline based project means
let's suppose there is a data source so
from there how i am going to connect
from a multiple data sources how i am
going to filter out all of these
required informations how i am going to
perform a different different kind of
transformation operation different
different kind of a load operations and
then finally how i'm going to dump my
data set into my databasing solution or
maybe into a databases so this kind of a
pipelining project is required so where
in one single project you will end up
using this entire things and project
along with a deployment and scheduler is
very very important right so i'm not
talking about the op side but yes this
is the berman requirement that you are
supposed to fulfill so you can come for
the resume discussions you can do a
project which is available inside your
dashboard and then yes you will be
eligible for applying for a job in a
market which is available on a different
different platforms so this is a basic
roadmap i would say
in my next data engineering roadmap so
i'm going to talk about a data
engineering roadmap
in
depth so if you have like this video so
you can give a comment and then you can
let me know that
whether this input is useful for all of
you or not if not for sure so anyhow i
told you that in my next video so again
i'm going to drill down each and
everything in on a micro label and i'm
going to explain you so why this
component is required and why that
component is not required so in this way
i'll try to give you explanation till
then thank you so much and see you again
in my next session thank you so much
