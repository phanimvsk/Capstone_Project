["look fair warning if you're feeling a",
 'little hungry right now you might want',
 'to pause this video and grab a snack',
 'before continuing because',
 "i'm going to explain the difference",
 'between machine learning',
 'and deep learning',
 'by',
 'talking about pizza',
 'delicious',
 'tasty',
 'pizza',
 "now before we get to that let's let's",
 'address the fundamental question here',
 'what is the difference between these two',
 'terms',
 'well put simply deep learning is a',
 'subset of machine learning actually the',
 'the hierarchy goes like this at the top',
 'we have a',
 'i',
 'or artificial intelligence now a',
 'subfield of a i',
 'is ml',
 'or machine learning',
 'beneath that then we have n n or',
 'neural networks',
 'and they make up the backbone of',
 'deep',
 'learning algorithms dl',
 'and',
 'here on the ibm technology channel we',
 'have a whole bunch of videos on these',
 'topics you might want to consider',
 'subscribing',
 'now machine learning algorithms leverage',
 'structured labeled data to make',
 'predictions',
 'so',
 "let's build one a model to determine",
 'whether',
 'we should order pizza for dinner',
 'there are three main factors that',
 "influence that decision so let's map",
 'those out as inputs the first of those',
 "inputs we'll call",
 'x1',
 'and x1 asks will it save time by',
 'ordering out',
 'we can say yes with a one or no with a',
 'zero',
 'yes it will so x that equals one',
 'now x two',
 'that input says will i lose weight by',
 'ordering pizza',
 "that's a zero i'm i'm ordering all the",
 'toppings',
 'and x3',
 'will it save me',
 'money',
 'actually i have a coupon for a free',
 'pizza today',
 "so that's a one",
 'now look these binary responses ones and',
 "zeros i'm using them for simplicity but",
 'neurons in a network can represent',
 'values from well everything to',
 'everything negative infinity to positive',
 'infinity',
 'with our inputs defined we can assign',
 'weights to determine importance',
 'larger weights make a single inputs',
 'contribution to the output more',
 'significant compared to other inputs',
 "now my threshold here is five so let's",
 'weight each one of these w1',
 "well i'm going to give this a full",
 'five because i value my time',
 'and w2',
 "this was the will i lose weight 1 i'm",
 'going to rate this a 3 because i have',
 'some interest in keeping in shape',
 'and for w3',
 "i'm going to give this a 2 because like",
 "either way this isn't going to break the",
 'bank to order dinner',
 'now we plug these weights into our model',
 'and using an activation function we can',
 'calculate the output',
 'which in this case is the decision to',
 'order pizza or not',
 "so to calculate that we're going to",
 'calculate the y hat',
 "and we're going to use these weights and",
 "these inputs so here we've got 1 times 5",
 "we've got",
 '0 times 3',
 "and we've got 1 times",
 '2.',
 'and we need to consider as well our',
 'threshold which was',
 '5.',
 'so that gives us if we just add these up',
 "1 times 5 that's 5 plus",
 "0 times 3 that's 0 plus 1 times 2 that's",
 '2',
 'minus 5. well that gives us a total of',
 'positive 2.',
 'and because the output is a positive',
 'number this correlates to',
 'pizza night',
 "okay so that's machine learning but what",
 'differentiates',
 'deep learning',
 'well the answer to that is',
 'more than three',
 'as in a neural network is considered a',
 'deep neural network',
 'if it consists of more than three layers',
 'and',
 'that includes the input and the output',
 "layer so we've got our input and output",
 'we have multiple layers in the middle',
 'and this would be considered',
 'a deep',
 'learning',
 'network',
 'classical machine learning is more',
 'dependent on human intervention to learn',
 'human experts well they determine a',
 'hierarchy of features to understand the',
 'differences between data inputs so if i',
 'showed you a series of images of',
 'different types of fast food like pizza',
 'burger and taco',
 'you could label these in a data set for',
 'processing by the neural network a human',
 'expert here has determined the',
 'characteristics which distinguish each',
 'picture as the specific fast food type',
 'so for example it might be the bread of',
 'each food type might be a distinguishing',
 'feature across each picture',
 'now this is known as supervised learning',
 'because the process incorporates human',
 'intervention or human supervision',
 "deep machine learning doesn't",
 'necessarily require a labeled data set',
 'it can ingest unstructured data in its',
 'raw form like text and images and it can',
 'automatically determine the set of',
 'features which distinguish pizza',
 'burger and taco from one another',
 'by observing patterns in the data a deep',
 'learning model can cluster inputs',
 'appropriately',
 'these algorithms discover hidden',
 'patterns of data groupings without the',
 "need for human intervention and they're",
 'known as unsupervised learning',
 'most deep neural networks are feed',
 'forward that means that they go in one',
 'direction from the input to the output',
 'however you can also train your model',
 'through something called a back',
 'propagation',
 'that is it moves in the opposite',
 'direction from output to input',
 'back propagation allows us to calculate',
 'and attribute the error associated with',
 'each neuron and allows us to adjust and',
 'fit the algorithm appropriately',
 'so when we talk about machine learning',
 'and deep learning',
 "we're essentially talking about the same",
 "field of study neural networks they're",
 'the foundation of both types of learning',
 'and both are considered subfields of a i',
 'the main distinction between the two are',
 'that number of layers in a neural',
 'network',
 'more than three',
 'and whether or not human intervention is',
 'required to label data',
 'pizza burgers tacos',
 "yeah that's uh that's enough for today",
 "it's time for lunch",
 'oh oh and before i go if you did enjoy',
