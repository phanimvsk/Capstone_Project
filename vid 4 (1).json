   "context": "ver, you can also train your model through something called back-propagation.\nThat is, it moves in the opposite direction from output to input.\nBack-propagation allows us to calculate and attribute the error associated with each neuron\nand allows us to adjust and fit the algorithm appropriately.\nSo when we talk about machine learning and deep learning, we're essentially talking about the same field of study.\nNeural networks, they're the foundation of both types of learning, and both are considered subfields of a AI.\nThe main distinction between the two are that number of layers in a neural network,\nmore than three\nand whether or not human intervention is required to label data.\nPizza, burgers, tacos.\nYeah, that's that's enough for today.\nIt's time for lunch.\nOh, oh, before I go, if you did enjoy this video, h"
