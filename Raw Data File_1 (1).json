So,this is how it looks when you run the command and this is how it would look in the callzone.So, we have 4 sections of output we have call, we have residual, we have coefficients, and we havesome few heuristics at the bottom. So, now, let us look at each of these and what they mean in depth.Now, call displays the formula which we have used.
