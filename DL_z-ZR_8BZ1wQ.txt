i want to discuss the difference between
pytorch
tensorflow and keras in this video
pytorch and tensorflow are two
most popular deep learning frameworks
there is a
third framework called cntk by microsoft
but it is not as popular as the other
two
pytorch is by facebook and tensorflow is
by google
now you will ask me what is keras then
keras is not a full-fledged deep
learning framework
just like pytorch and tensorflow keras
is just a nice
wrapper around tensorflow cntk and
theano
so previously when people were using
tensorflow or cntk directly
or the programming uh in these
frameworks was not that easy
it was a little difficult so then keras
was created as just a nice wrapper
around these libraries and it just
provided
a convenience so it is not a
full-fledged framework
but it just provides your convenience
here i have a code snippet where
you can see if you import keras by the
way if you want to install keras you can
just do paper install keras
and the code snippet will look something
like this if you're directly using keras
and nowadays with tensorflow 2.0
they have made it a part of tensorflow
library itself
so here is another code snippet where
you can use keras
directly from tensorflow so in all our
tutorials we are not going to install
keras separately
we will just use tensorflow and then we
will use keras which is
inbuilt into tensorflow to make use of
their convenient
apis now if you're using
a keras previously like you can specify
a backend so in the code snippet of
keras
you you have you would have seen the
back end was
tensorflow by default and you can change
the backend you can change it to cnk
cntk or theano but we're not going to go
into all of that
we'll just use tensorflow and use
keras within the tensorflow or to write
our programs.
